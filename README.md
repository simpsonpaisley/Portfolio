# Portfolio Progress
<p>I will document my progress in this file.</p>
<h2> Plans for Portfolio </h2>
<p> Although I did have a portfolio already, I made this when I was first starting out with web development, and am not keen on the design. I would also like to create some cleaner and more semantic code for my new portfolio. With my new portfolio, I hope to create a better design, that will be more responsive on mobiles, and will start with deveoloping the site for mobile, and then use media queries to adjust it for desktop use. I think this will be the best way forward, as mobile users account for a high proportion of website users, so should not just be an afterthought. </p>

<p> Although I am currentely mainly comfortable with HTML and CSS, as well as Bootstrap for CSS, I hope to include some JavaScript as I continue to learn, to make my site more dynamic. </p> 

<h2> Initial Commit - 05/07/21 </h2>
<p> This was my initial commit, in which I cloned my repository into my Portfolio folder, and commited my initial empty files, index.html and styles.css. index.html will be used for my home page, and, as this site should be quite small, styles.css will be used for all pages. Using this same stylesheet for all pages will also make it easier for me to carry over styles across multiple pages. </p> 

<h2> Logo - 05/07/21 </h2>
<p> In this commit, I attempted to create a logo for my portfolio, using HTML and CSS. The aim of my logo was to have some gradient coloured initials overlapping each other slightly. I managed to do this using position properties on the second letter. This allowed me to overlap the text. I was able to use webkit tools to easily create gradient text. Although I am fairly pleased with how this went, using HTML and CSS for a logo does create some problems, as if I want to use it in multiple places at different sizes, I would need to change quite a few properties as the font size changes. Because of this, I will remake the logo as an image file, to be able to more easily reuse it. </p>
